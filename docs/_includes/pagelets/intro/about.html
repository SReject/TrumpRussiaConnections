    <p>This document’s purpose is to compile all the info I have gathered from
    every available source (Reddit, twitter, media, etc) on the Trump-Russia
    connection. I’m not out for conspiracy theories, anything without a
    reputable source will not be included. My only goal here is to inform. I
    will continue to improve this document as I go. If you feel I missed
    anything important, find any errors, or have any suggestions please let me
    know via the issues link at the top of the page</p>

    <p>This is my own attempt to recompile the work done by PostimusMaximus into
    a project that is easier to maintain while providing better hosting for the
    information via github pages.</p>
