    I encourage you to follow through with the sources. I gave very short
    descriptions for the sake of keeping the document readable and as you can
    see itâ€™s still excessive in length. This will hopefully give a clean
    overview, but the sources will provide you with the full picture of how
    extensive things are. Feedback may result in me typing up more extensive in
    document form as opposed to relying on sources to provide the bulk of the
    information.
